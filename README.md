# Go-Test-1

To run program use: 
go build Gotestpg1
go build Gotestpg2
./Gotestpg1 [int]
./Gotestpg2 [int]

Gotestpg1 should print a similar output as the following:
Array initialization runtime:  -166ns
Slice initialization runtime:  -125ns
Map initialization runtime:  -1.458Âµs
Array Increment runtime:  -83ns
Slice Increment runtime:  -83ns
Map increment runtime:  -500ns

Gotestpg2 should print a similar output as the following:
Sort for Array: -x
Stable for Array: -x
Sort for Slice: -x
Stable for Slice: -x

3. No it doesn't because I wasn't able to get the second program working.
